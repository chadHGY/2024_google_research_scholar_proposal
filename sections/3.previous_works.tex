Our prior research endeavors have laid a solid foundation for the proposed study, yielding significant advancements in understanding mental health dynamics\cite{dinga2019evaluating,wolfers2021replicating,rutherford2022normative}. Our exploration of age-based normative models unveiled substantial heterogeneity within clinical groups, providing crucial insights into the complexity of mental health conditions. Moreover, recent strides have been made in integrating cognition into our modeling frameworks and linking these cognitive aspects to polygenic risk scores\cite{kjelkenes2023mapping}. Scaling our methodologies to encompass populations exceeding 50,000 individuals has further solidified our ability to derive comprehensive insights at a larger scale\cite{rutherford2022charting}.
These achievements not only signify our expertise in the field but also serve as a springboard for the proposed research. Our collaborations with esteemed partners and the exceptional research environment at the University of TÃ¼bingen have been instrumental in these achievements. These partnerships have fostered an environment conducive to innovative research, providing the necessary resources and expertise to ensure the feasibility and excellence of the proposed project.
