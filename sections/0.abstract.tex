\section{Abstract}
Mental health diagnosis and treatment primarily rely on symptom-based assessments, hindering the discovery of predictive markers. Leveraging normative modeling and machine learning, this proposal aims to chart the individual heterogeneity, predicting brain architecture/function across regions to enhance precision in psychiatry. Using extensive reference samples and novel modeling techniques, this research seeks to revolutionize mental health diagnostics, offering personalized insights for improved patient care.
