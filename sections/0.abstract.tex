\section{Abstract}
Mental health diagnostics often rely on symptom-based assessments, limiting the discovery of predictive markers. This proposal utilizes normative modeling and cutting-edge machine learning techniques to decode individual heterogeneity, predicting brain architecture and function across regions. The goal is to revolutionize mental health diagnostics by offering personalized insights for improved, reliable, and fair patient care. Leveraging extensive reference samples, this research aims to impact population health by unraveling nuanced mental health patterns. The innovative algorithms developed here will address the complexity of mental health data, potentially uncovering novel markers and paving the way for tailored interventions and treatments.
